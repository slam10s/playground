# College Tennis Playground

This repository displays college tennis data in a way that my eventually be used at the <a href="https://www.slam.tennis/teams/rankings.asp" target="_blank">SLAM.Tennis</a> website. All the information shown here is generated from this <a href="https://github.com/slam10s/college-data" target="_blank">public data repository</a>.

We will eventually be incorporating results from UTR and ITF tournaments in which college tennis players participate.
